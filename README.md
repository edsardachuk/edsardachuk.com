This is a modern **Drupal 11** project built by Ed Sardachuk. **DDEV** is used for local development.
Itâ€™s a **headless Drupal site** with a **React front end** powered by the **Next.js** framework.
The Next.js source code is located in the `notebook` folder.

Although this is a demonstrative project, it will be launched and serve as a live production site hosted on **Digital Ocean** (for backend) and **Netlify**.
**Next.js** is used to generate static pages based on content managed in Drupal, ensuring performance and scalability.
**Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, providing a clean, efficient, and maintainable development workflow.

The combination of **Drupal + Next.js + Tailwind CSS** forms a powerful modern stack that enables rapid development, clean design implementation, and excellent performance out of the box.
This bundle allows for fast prototyping and production-ready builds while maintaining flexibility for complex enterprise needs.

A **test database** is included with the project to demonstrate full functionality and provide ready-to-run examples for local development and integration testing.
